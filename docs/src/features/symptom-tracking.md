* **Quick Logs**: Log quick single-point occurrences in seconds.
* **Symptom-Free Days**: Record days without symptoms to establish true baseline correlations.
* **Visual Location Maps**: Tappable SVG head and body maps with multi-region selection and chip fallbacks.
* **Triggers & Relief**: Track custom and built-in triggers, relief methods, and medication effectiveness (*Helped*, *Partly*, *Didn't help*).
* **Auto-Correlated Context**: Automatically surfaces day-before (D-1) and day-of (D0) food names, water, sleep, exercise, medication logs, and cycle phase without duplicate entry.

## 2. Managing Symptoms & Customization

Navigate to **Check-in -> Symptoms -> Manage Symptoms** to configure your tracking setup:
* **Templates**: Choose section bundles tailored to specific conditions (e.g. Migraine with aura phases vs. Lower Back Pain with body regions).
* **Severity Scales**: Configure scales per symptom (`1-5`, `1-10`, `none-severe`, `count`, `text`).
* **Custom Fields**: Add typed custom fields per symptom (e.g., *Blood glucose*, *Inhaler puffs*, *Rash diameter cm*).
* **Option Lists**: Customize, reorder, or add custom locations, qualities, associated symptoms, triggers, and relief methods.
