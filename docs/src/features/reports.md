# Reports

The **Reports** page gives you insights into the data you record in SparkyFitness. It covers your food diary, water intake, exercise, body measurements, fasting, medications, and metrics synced from your health platform or fitness tracker. You can view this information for any date range, explore it through charts, and export it for analysis in other applications.

The Reports page is available from the top navigation bar when using SparkyFitness in a web browser.

### Nutrients

The **Nutrients** page shows information over the selected range:

- **Weekly alcohol summary:** your alcohol intake for the 7-day week containing your range's end date (aligned to your preferred first day of the week), handy for monitoring alcohol intake.
- **Hydration trend:** your daily [Water Intake](/features/diary/water-intake) across the range, with the daily average.
- **Period nutrition summary:** your totals for the whole range, compared against your [goals](/features/goals), including your overall cumulative balance. Select a measure from the drop-down box, or combine multiple.
- **Nutrient charts:** a grid of charts tracking individual nutrients (protein, carbs, fat, and any custom nutrients you use) across the range. Hover over the charts to see how you performed against your goals for the day.

The nutrient columns and charts you see here are controlled by [Settings → Nutrient Display Settings](/features/settings/nutrient-display-settings), and the nutrients of your supplements are included in these totals, so your numbers reflect everything you actually consume.

### Measurements

The **Measurements** tab shows your body measurements and synced health metrics, each in its own chart widget:

- **Body measurements:** all measurements including your weight, height and BMR are shown as a trend chart.
- **Your custom measurement categories:** every category you create in [Measurements](/features/measurements) also has a trend chart.
- **Health sync metrics:** information provided by your health sync provider (e.g. Google Health, Apple Health, etc.) is also reported. This includes steps, distance, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.

The grid is **resizable**: drag widgets to rearrange or resize them, and your layout is saved, so the tab looks the same way next time you visit.

### Fasting

The **Fasting** tab turns your logged fasting sessions into a consistency report over the selected range:

- **Summary cards:** **Total Fasts**, **Total Hours**, **Avg Duration (hrs)**, and **Longest Fast (hrs)** for the range.
- **Daily Fasting Duration:** a bar chart of the hours fasted per day.
- **Fasting Zones:** a pie chart showing how your fasts are distributed across duration zones.
- **Fasting History:** a table of every fast in the range with **Start Date**, **End Date**, **Duration**, and **Protocol**. A fast in progress shows **Ongoing**, and fasts without a named protocol show **Custom**.
- **Fasting Heatmap (Last 90 Days):** a GitHub-style grid where each square is a day and the shade of green grows with the hours fasted (under 12h, 12–16h, 16–20h, and 20h+). This is the one report that always shows the last 90 days, regardless of your selected range.
- **Fasting Trends:** a line chart of the 3-day moving average of daily fasting hours, which smooths out single-day noise so you can see the real trend.

### Exercise

The **Exercise** tab analyzes your [exercise entries](/features/diary/exercise) over the range. The **view switcher** at the top lets you see **All Workouts**, just **Strength & Resistance**, or just **Cardio & GPS**, and the **Group by** selector aggregates data by day, week, month, or year.

The **All Workouts** view brings everything together: the **Exercise Volume & Interval Totals** chart, snapshot charts (**Muscle Heat Map**, **Muscle Group Recovery**, **Exercise Variety Score**, and **Training Volume by Muscle Group**), and the same analysis charts as the Strength & Resistance view.

**Strength & Resistance** charts include:

- **Key stats:** a summary of the headline numbers for the range.
- **Volume Trend:** total training volume over time.
- **Max Weight Trend:** how your top weights progress.
- **Estimated 1RM Trend:** your estimated one-rep max over time.
- **Best Set by Rep Range** and **Reps vs Weight:** how your strongest sets shift across rep ranges.
- **Set Performance Analysis** and **Time Under Tension Trend:** per-set intensity metrics.
- **PR Progression** and **Personal Records:** your bests and how they've evolved.
- **Workout Heatmap:** a consistency grid of your workout days.

A **More analysis** button expands the full set of advanced charts, and **filters** for equipment, muscle group, or a specific exercise apply across the dashboard — so you can watch a single lift's progression in isolation.

**Cardio & GPS** shows the activity sessions synced from your phone or watch: pace, cadence, heart rate (including heart-rate zones when your provider reports them), elevation, per-session stats, a lap-by-lap table, and a map of your route.

### Sleep

The **Sleep** tab requires sleep data from your wearable or health sync — see [External Providers](/features/settings/external-providers), [Google Health](/features/settings/google-health), [COROS](/features/settings/coros), or [Polar](/features/settings/polar). If no sleep data falls in your selected range, the tab says so instead of showing empty charts.

When data is available you get:

- **Sleep charts:** sleep stage breakdown (hypnogram), heart rate during sleep, respiration rate, blood oxygen (SpO2), and HRV across the range.
- **Sleep History & Analytics:** a table of every night in the range, with bedtime, wake time, duration, time asleep, sleep score, efficiency, sleep debt, awake periods, data source, and a plain-language insight for the night (**Good Sleep**, **Needs Improvement**, or **High Debt**).
- **Export to CSV:** a button next to the table downloads the full history for your own analysis.

- - -

### Stress

The **Stress** tab covers the two stress-related signals the app can track:

- **Raw stress:** the stress levels your wearable reports over the range. If your device doesn't report stress data, the chart shows *No raw stress data available.*
- **Daily mood:** a zoomable chart of the mood you log each day, so you can see how it moves across weeks.

- - -

### Medications

The **Medications** tab (*Medications Report* — "Analyze dose correlations, side effects, and adherence trends") is built for people managing a medication regimen, with particular depth for GLP-1 therapy:

- **Summary cards:** **Average Adherence %** (the percentage of scheduled doses logged as taken), **GLP-1 Injections** (active GLP-1 injection doses in the range), and **Reported Side-Effects** (the number of unique symptoms, built-in or custom, logged in the range).
- **Charts:** use the **Customize Charts** button to toggle exactly which of these are shown:
  - *Nausea Severity vs. GLP-1 Medication Dose* — your daily peak nausea (0–10) overlaid on your dose in mg.
  - *Weight Trend vs. Target Weight* — daily weight against a target-weight line, in your preferred weight unit.
  - *Daily Adherence Trend (%)* — dose-taking consistency per day.
  - *GLP-1 Daily Check-In Trends* — hunger, food noise, fullness, and energy levels (0–10) tracked alongside your dose.
  - *Medication Log* — your medications, entries, injections, and symptom entries within the range.
- **Symptom & side-effect correlations:** four descriptive correlation cards, each with a strength badge, a confidence score, and a plain-language takeaway:
  - *Hydration vs. Constipation* — e.g., a negative correlation reads: "Strong Hydration Benefit: Higher water intake correlates with lower constipation severity."
  - *Protein Intake vs. Nausea* — whether nausea follows your protein intake up or down.
  - *Sleep Duration vs. Fatigue* — whether more sleep is associated with less fatigue.
  - *GLP-1 Dose vs. Nausea Severity* — whether your doses are tracking with your nausea.

  The page is explicit that these correlations are "purely descriptive calculations over the chosen date range and do not imply clinical causality."

- **Sharing with your prescriber:** the **Prescriber-Ready Data Export** card offers a **Print / Save PDF Report** button that produces a clean PDF summary you can hand to your doctor, plus a **Download CSV Data** button for the raw numbers.

### Table

The **Table** tab gives you the raw data behind everything above:

- **Table switcher:** select between **All**, **Food Diary**, **Exercise Entries**, **Body Measurements**, and any **custom measurement category** you've created.
- **Filters:** the **Exercise Entries** table can be filtered by exercise name and by set type.
- **Download (CSV):** every table has a download button, so you can export your food diary, exercise entries, body measurements, or custom measurement data to use in a spreadsheet or any other tool.
