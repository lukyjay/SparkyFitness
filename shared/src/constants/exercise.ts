 * Exercise modality selects which per-set editor clients render
 * (issue #1903 stage 2):
 * - weight_reps: weight + reps inputs (default strength table)
 * - reps_only: reps input, no weight column
 * - bodyweight_reps: reps plus a signed weight for bodyweight movements —
 *   positive is load added (+20 kg on a dip belt), negative is assistance
 *   (−15 kg from a band or machine). Volume and estimated 1RM count the
 *   lifter's body weight plus that value (see `effectiveLoadKg`).
 * - weight_duration: weight plus a duration in seconds, for loaded holds
 *   (weighted plank, wall sit with a plate)
 * - weight_distance: weight plus a distance, for carries and sled work
 *   (farmer's walk, yoke, sandbag, sled push). The distance is stored in km
 *   like every other set distance; clients show metres or yards
 * - duration: single duration-in-seconds input
 * - duration_distance: cardio backed by a single set carrying duration
 *   (seconds) + distance (km); clients render a duration+distance form for
 *   entries with at most one set and fall back to a duration-style set
 *   table for multi-set entries
