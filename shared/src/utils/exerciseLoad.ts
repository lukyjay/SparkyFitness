 * off by assistance (negative), so the load is the lifter's body weight plus
 * it: a +20 kg dip at 80 kg moves 100 kg, a −30 kg assisted pull-up moves
 * 50 kg. With no known body weight the added weight alone is counted, so a
 * weighted set still registers and an assisted one counts nothing rather
 * than something negative.
 *
 * Every volume/1RM calculation (server SQL included, which mirrors this rule
 * inline) goes through here or copies it exactly.
